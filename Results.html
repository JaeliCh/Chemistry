<H1> Conclusion </H1>
<p>In this experiment, we clearly saw how red cabbage juice changes color when mixed with different substances, 
<br> depending on their pH. Very acidic substances such as lemon juice, orange juice, Lipton tea, Coca-Cola and Ronald's
<br> urine turn the juice red or pink, indicating a low pH (0-3). Slightly acidic substances such as milk, yogurt and 
<br> Nelson's urine color the juice light purple, indicating a pH close to 6. Alkaline substances such as chlorine and 
<br> baking soda, on the other hand, colored it yellow and turquoise, indicating a high pH value (9-13). Substances such
<br> as soap and alcohol remained purple, which means they are neutral and have a pH of around 7. This experiment has 
<br> shown that red cabbage juice is a good natural way to determine whether something is acidic, neutral or basic by 
<br> simply looking at the color it takes on.
