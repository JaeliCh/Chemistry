<H1> Introduction </H1>
<p> In this "Red Cabbage pH indicator Experiment" we used the red cabbage juice as a natural way to test whether 
<br> everyday liquisds are acid, neutral, or basic. Red cabbage contains a pigment called anthocyanin that 
<br> change color depending on how acidic or basic something is. Thanks to the anthocyanin, we can see the PH of
<br> a substance just by observing how its color changes. The main goal of the experiment was to observe how the 
<br> colors changed and compare them to the pH level of each substance we tested.

<H1> Hypothesis: </H1> 
<p> We thought that by adding red cabbage juice to different substances, they would change color depending on the
<br> pH level of each one. These color changes would help us easily identify whether each substance was acidic, 
<br> neutral, or basic, and give us a better understanding of how pH works. </br>
